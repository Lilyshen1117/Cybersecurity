# Cybersecurity Assessment

Policies, Standards and Guidelines

With the growing use of cloud solutions for keeping and maintaining Kohler data, and requiring new and ever increasing firewall configurations for transporting and accessing data by outside sources, we needed to create a formal review process. 

All software purchases are being reviewed, whether new, renewals, additions, etc.   From a security standpoint, we are concerned with Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of Kohler data.  We need enough information to evaluate these three points. 

## Initial Review


## Vendor（s）Survey

## FAQ
1. When does it need an assessment?

2. How do I obtain this service?
  
A request for an assessment can be made by submitting a non-standard request through the IT Service Catalog.Request is reviewed by the Enterprise Architect Office (EAO), and if approved, will submit a Service Now request to Security.  Requestor will receive an email of this submission and can follow the workflow of the submission.

3. How long will it take？

The Cybersecurity Team strives to complete the security portion of any assessment within 10 business days.  This will vary depending on the application, the nature of the data, the availability and timeliness of information, and the number of requests in queue.
