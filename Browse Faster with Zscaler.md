*Cloud Security: Rethink networking and security to empower Kohler’s transformation*
 Kohler IT has some very good news for outlying Kohler locations where internet performance has been an issue.

IT’s Cybersecurity and Networking teams are working hard to install new systems that will increase internet speed in remote Kohler locations.

Currently, the best Kohler internet speeds are near our major data center locations, including Kohler, Cheltenham (England), Shangahi (China), Gurgaon (India), New Zealand, Korea, and Thailand. Away from these areas, internet speeds suffer due to current technical and security settings.

In the past, this system of internet access served Kohler well. Kohler is always growing, though. New locations keep popping up away from these data centers, and all Kohler locations are relying more and more on cloud-based applications, which require faster internet performance.

## Introducing Zscaler

If you haven’t had Zscaler installed on your Kohler PC, it will be coming soon. Zscaler is the software and service that enables seamless and secure access to the internet. Internet performance will be faster and more secure with Zscaler.

“The locations that will see the largest change are Kohler’s most remote sites,” says Josh Miller, Systems Project Manager and the lead on the Zscaler project. “Some locations barely had the bandwidth to play a YouTube video. Zscaler internet access will change all that.”

## Rolling the system out

While we can all relate to faster internet through this new software and service, plenty of back end work needs to be done to implement this system. Most of the groundwork for Zscaler in North America is complete. The next step of the project is to build and complete the groundwork in EMEA and APAC, and the system for all 180 remote Kohler sites are due to be completed in mid-2019.

Faster, more secure internet for remote Kohler locations. Kohler IT and Zscaler are making it happen.
