Our data is valuable. To protect our data appropriately, a new way of protecting your documents is here, and it affects everyone who sends email or creates Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint files.

Labels include:

| Highly Protected | Our highest level of protection for extremely sensitive material. | Information that is extremely sensitive and is intended for use only by named individuals within the company|
| Confidential | for use only by specified groups of associates or authorized associates. | Information that is sensitive within the Company and is intended for use only by specified groups of associates or authorized personnel.|
| Internal | Information that is generally available to Kohler associates. |Information that is generally available to Kohler Co. associates|
| Public | Non-sensitive information for external release |Non-sensitive information available for external release|

## FAQs

1. Why do we need sensitivity label on each document?
The cybersecurity team have a duty to protect the digital assets of Kohler Co and affiliates.  We need to understand the value of each digital asset to apply the appropriate security.  When you classify the document or email, we can then apply the correct level of security to that asset.  
2.	Why can’t we have a default label as most of my emails are internal
The team thought long and hard on this one.  We felt that if all documents and email are given a default label, then the value of having labels is vastly reduced as most associates will leave the default and not change it.  we need associates to think about the value of each asset.  

3.	Can I move the footer as it interferes with my power point presentations
This is a limitation of the Microsoft product.  We have to set one position and then that applies to all associates.  We chose the most appropriate place to put it for most people.  

4.	Why do I have to have the footer on every PowerPoint side
This is a limitation of the Microsoft product and cannot be changed, however its good practice to have the awareness of the asset value shown on each slide
5.	Why are the labels only mandatory on desktop versions of Office?
This is a limitation of the Microsoft product, And we expect the product to mature to include mobile and web versions

6.	We create content in other programs not just MS Office, what are you doing to add labels to those?
This is a limitation of the Microsoft product.  We will be providing instructions in the next phase on how to label other document types using the Azure information protection client or windows explorer, where you can right click and classify bulk documents.  
7.	The footer interferes with existing footers in my department, how can I turn them off?
Footers are a great way to show the value of a document.  We advise that existing footers are either right justified or placed above the default footer.  

8.	The footer is in English.  My documents are in a different language, why cant it be automatically translated?
This is a limitation of the Microsoft product, while the label buttons and tooltips are translated, we cannot provide a translation for each language unless we create individual labels for each language.  We tired this in the pilot and concluded that it created too much of an admin overhead and makes further integrations for security controls far harder to implement.  We are confident that as English is the language of Business in Kohler Co, that the English footer is appropriate. 
9.	How can I apply labels from Iphone or Android?
In Iphone when you create a new email, press the 3 dots at the bottom of the edit screen in any office application and choose Add Sensitivity. 

10.	How should I classify documents and email sent to business partners which are not highly protected, confidential, internal or public? 
The Internal label can be used for Kohler and business partners.  

11.	Do I have to go and classify all existing documents?
We are starting with new and newly edited documents only.  If you open an existing document and make changes and save it, you will be prompted to classify the document.  Over a period of time, all digital assets will therefore be classified.  In a further phase we will be adding classifications en mass to existing file respositories based on rules that we will work with the businesses to develop.
